# NSSAL Case Study  
### Gender and Heterosexual Partner Trends

This repository presents a **data analysis case study** based on the  
**British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NSSAL-2 and NSSAL-3)**.

The project investigates whether **gender is a significant factor** in the change of the number of heterosexual partners over time, using statistical analysis and data visualization to support evidence-based conclusions.

## 🧠 Problem Context

Public health and social research organisations rely on large-scale surveys to understand changes in behaviour over time.  
However, interpreting trends — especially across gender — requires careful statistical handling.

This case study was conducted as part of a **Data Analyst internship-style project**, focusing on:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Feature selection
- Exploratory analysis
- Statistical reasoning
- Clear communication of insights
